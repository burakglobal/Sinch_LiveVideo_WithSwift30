# Sinch_LiveVideo_WithSwift30
Live Video Chat with Sinch using Swift 3

Hello Everyone,

I made Live Video Chat in Swift 3.0 with Sinch. I added three viewController for you to see how you can implement Sinch to your Swift 3.0 project.

I didn't add Storyboards but I believe you guys can figure out. If not, Feel free to contact with me for complete project.
